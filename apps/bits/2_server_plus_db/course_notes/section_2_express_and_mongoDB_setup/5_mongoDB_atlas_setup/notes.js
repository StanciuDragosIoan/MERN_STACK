/*  
    mongoDB atlas = noSQL database 

    uses documents (instead of tables)

    very similar to JSON syntax

    can be installed locally or used in the cloud with mongoDB Atlas

    cloud is easier to manage

        created the MERN_COURSE project in mongoDB Atlas
        built a cluster

        added a DB user for mongo

            user: mern_course123
            pw: mern_course123

        whitelisted my ip address (actually allowed access from anywhere but ip address
        should be whitelisted)
