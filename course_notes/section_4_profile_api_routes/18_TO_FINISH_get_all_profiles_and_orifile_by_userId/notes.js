/*
    Get All Profiles & Profile by user id

    continued in profile.js

    continued to work on the profile routes (added 1 more)

    created a get route to fetch all profiles

    tested with jdoe@gmail.com;

    fetched all the profiles with:
        http://localhost:5000/api/profile

        *initially it returned only brad's profile

    created a new project for johndoe (2nd user we had created):

        logged in johndoe through http://localhost:5000/api/auth (to get the token )

    copied token

    went back to the create/update profile route: http://localhost:5000/api/profile (replaced brad's 
    token with the 1 of jdoe)

    modified profile and made post request
